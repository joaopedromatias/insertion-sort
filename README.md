# Insertion Sort

The array is splitted in sorted array and unsorted array. They are separated by a pointer which starts at the second index of the array.

The comparison is done with the first item of the unsorted array (current) to the items of the sorted array, then it is placed in the right position of the sorted array. The pointer increases by one after each iteration until the end of the array.

**`Time complexity upper bound`**: O(n^2)
